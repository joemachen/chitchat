# Release notes

## v1.3.0 — Users panel, links & protected channels

**Users panel**
- **Current room hidden for you** — Your own entry no longer shows "in &lt;room&gt;" (e.g. "in Sports & Gambling Tips"); other users still see each other's current room.

**Links & images**
- **Mint Linux Firefox** — Link and image clicks now behave the same as on other systems (explicit `window.open` for consistent new-tab behavior).

**Protected channels**
- **Rename restricted** — Only Surfer Girl can rename protected channels. Room owners and users with edit permission can no longer rename protected channels.
